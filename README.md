This is some code that generates teams (sport) based upon a few factors.

The goal is for the algorithm to generate teams based upon (Ranking Points, MMR and Penalty).

Ranking points: is the idea that players has an initial ranking point
MMR: is value that is being calculated throughout an GameEvent ( lets say friends playing volleyboll, and plays a few matches ), MMR is adjusted after each match
Penalty: is to try to avoid same players playing with eachother all the time

To be able to generate teams a roster of players and how many courts is to be used.

There is also a class that creates team names randomly.
